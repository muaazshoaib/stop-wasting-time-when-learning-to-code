# [Stop wasting time when learning to code](https://youtu.be/s6dMWzZKjTs)

## 1. Don't learn things randomly
Try to learn from udemy course

## 2. Focus on one thing at a time
Stick to only one framework

## 3. Be an active learner
Write and run all code that the instructor teaches in a video lecture

## 4. Don't just memorize
At the end of each section build your own app without following video tutorials.

## 5. Build Stuff
Make your portfolio
